# Item Magnet

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that adds a magnet to the buried treasure chest.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world. If the pack has a `resourcepack` as well, put it into the `resourcepacks` folder of your Minecraft installation and enable it.

## Compatibility

The data pack changes the following Vanilla data:

### Loot Tables

- `chests/buried_treasure`

You'd have to manually merge the loot table files of data packs that change the same vanilla loot tables to be able to load them at the same time.

## License

The data pack is licensed under the GPLv3. For more information, take a look at the license file within this repository.

## Inspiration

The ideas are taken from [this website][mod] and re-implemented as one of my first data packs ever created.
